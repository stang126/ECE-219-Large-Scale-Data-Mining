# Project 4: Regression and Twitter Data Analysis

This repo contains the completed notebook for Project 4; it does not contain the diamonds dataset or the twitter text files. To run the notebook, ensure all required files are in the same folder and run the code. The Twitter text file processing steps are located under Question 10 in the notebook; simply ensure that both the #Gohawks and #Gopatriots JSON files have been imported into a list and the notebook will process the rest of the data to be used for Question 10.
