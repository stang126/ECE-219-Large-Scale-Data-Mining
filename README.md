## Project Repository for ECE219 - Large-Scale Data Mining: Models and Algorithms

### Project One: End-to-End Pipeline to Classify News Articles
- Project One involves using NLP for classifying document categories. The project includes data cleaning and the following supervised learning algorithms: Multiclass SVM, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes. The last portion of the project also involves GLoVE embeddings. 
- Libraries Used: Pandas, MatplotLib, Re, Numpy, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, Seaborn
  
### Project Two: Data Representations and Clustering
- Project Two involves clustering newspaper categories. The project includes NLP, dimensionality reduction with SVD, UMAP, Autoencoder, and NMF and the following unsupervised clustering algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative clustering, HDBScan, PCA.
- Libraries Used: Scikit_learn, Pandas, SciPy, UMAP, HDBScan, PyTorch, MatplotLib

### Project Three: Recommender Systems
- Project Three involves creating a recommender system for movies using an IMDB movie rating data set. the project includes predicting movie ratings using a k-NN and NMF-based collaborative filter on different subsets of the data.
- Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Suprise, Scikit-Learn

### Project Four: Regression Analysis and Define Your Own Task!
- Project Four involves exploratory data analysis and prediction of diamond prices based on their properties. The project includes using linear and polynomial regression with and without regularization, Multilayer Perceptron neural network, random forest regressor, and LightGBM for predicting the diamond prices. Additionally, this project involves exploratory data analysis and classification of Superbowl Tweets. This portion of the project involves data engineering and cleaning, data analysis, and prediction of which football team a fan belongs to, the time a tweet was posted, and the engagement of the tweet (likes, retweets, and replies). 
- Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, MatplotLib, Scikit-Learn
